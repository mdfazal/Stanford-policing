Using the above dataset one can make conclusions and also answers to some questions if asked .</p>
<p>
The questions that I made for myself based on the dataset and got the answer for is given as follows :- </p>
Do men or women speed more often?
Does gender affect who gets searched during a stop?
Why is search_type missing so often?
Which year had the least number of stops?
How does drugs activity change by time of day?
Do most stops occur at night
What is the mean stop_duration for violation_raw?

The above notebook also contains bar 2-d graph to give a visual conclusion. </p>
